## This plugin is feature complete
This means that everything that was planned for this plugin is implemented and there are no plans to add any more functions. The plugin is still being maintained and updated and bugs are being fixed, but no new feature requests are accepted. New features can still be implemented either via direct commission request or through patron votes.
This state is not permanent and can be changed in future. Feel free to still leave your feature request!
